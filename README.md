# 2D Median Filter for Image Smoothing
## Parallel Programming with the Java Fork/Join framework:
    The aim of this project is to implement two parallel filters for smoothing RGB 
    colour images using the Java Fork-Join library, and to benchmark the parallel 
    program to determine under which conditions parallelization is worth the
    extra effort involved.
